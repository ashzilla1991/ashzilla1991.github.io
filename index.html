<h2><span style="color: #082241;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><a id="selfassessment"></a>Self-Assessment</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Working towards my Computer Science degree, developing my ePortfolio &amp; even thinking about my future career goals has been an empowering experience. Throughout this program, I've had the privilege of learning &amp; refining my skills, tailoring my career path with the skills I've learned through coursework and real-world problems I could face throughout my career. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Collaborating in a team environment</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although collaboration isn't the first skill you think of when you think of Computer Science, it's vital in this field. I've completed a handful of team projects throughout this program; they emphasized the importance of communication. For example, a previous course required that I work with my classmates to add songs to a playlist project. This project was my first experience collaborating with others in GitHub. It required that I pull the latest version from GitHub (that included changes from my classmates) &amp; merge my changes to the master project. This activity taught me the importance of effective communication, making sure any notes I add for the team are thorough and concise, &amp; that not everyone has the same level of experience using this type of program, so communication is </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">key</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Communicating with stakeholders</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Communication is another skill you don't think of when you think of Computer Science, but my career plan is to become a developer. To ensure you're creating a product that meets the customer's needs, you must have the ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders. A previous course dealt with project management, sprint review meetings, etc. Sprint review meetings allow developers, stakeholders, and members of other teams to collaborate. Developers can show the work they've completed during the sprint &amp; receive direct feedback from the stakeholders. These meetings are vital because they allow stakeholders to give feedback &amp; the developer has the chance to communicate what is possible &amp; what isn't. Learning about these processes has helped to drive home the point of how important it is to communicate with stakeholders. If you're creating a product that doesn't meet their requirements, you'll have completed all that work for nothing.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Data Structures and Algorithms</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms is something I consider a necessity for Computer Science. Enhancing my artifact from CS 330 allowed me to practice the concepts I've learned throughout this program. I made enhancements to the collision detection algorithms to turn my artifact into a brick-breaker type of game. Completing these enhancements for the final project has shown me the importance of using the correct data structures and algorithms to improve the performance of your program. But it also helps to ensure you achieve the best balance of efficiency while maintaining complexity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Software Engineering and Database</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Database management &amp; software engineering are two principles I applied when enhancing my artifact from DAD 220. The main focus of the DAD 220 course was managing MySQL databases with CRUD operations. Although I found interacting with the database from the terminal simple, I felt creating a GUI to manage those databases would be a good idea &amp; that's where I was able to apply my software engineering know-how</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Developing</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the database application required researching, planning, development, testing, etc. Overall, I was able to incorporate my software engineering &amp; database management knowledge to create a working database application.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Security</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Security is a vital skill in Computer Science, although it's not the first skill that comes to mind. Although I haven't had many experiences with security-specific projects, I have learned to integrate security best practices. I've also developed a security-minded foundation &amp; that comes from a previous course where I learned about the software development life cycle (SDLC). Those lessons taught me to implement security in every aspect of the lifecycle, from the project planning to the deployment phase. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #f3d014;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Artifact Summary</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In my ePortfolio, I'll highlight the knowledge I've gained during my time in the Computer Science program with these artifacts. Each artifact acts as an example of my grasp on different key concepts &amp; they showcase my ability to take the knowledge I've gained throughout my time at SNHU &amp; apply it to real-world examples. These artifacts demonstrate my technical ability, but they also highlight my dedication to improvement &amp; my ability to problem-solve complex issues that could arise while completing this type of work.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I've included two artifacts in my ePortfolio. The first is a brick-breaker game I created from an artifact from a previous course, CS 330. The second artifact is a database application I created to manage a MySQL database &amp; the original data comes from DAD 220. My brick breaker game &amp; database application both showcase my software engineering &amp; design capabilities. With the brick-breaker game, I transformed the program into a functioning game &amp; I created the database application for managing a MySQL database. The database application also showcases my ability to manage a MySQL database, but it goes further because now users can point &amp; click instead of using the terminal. The brick-breaker game displays my ability to create/enhance algorithms to implement game-like mechanics into my program. Overall, the brick-breaker game &amp; database application come together as a complete portfolio because it shows my abilities from software engineering to database management &amp; algorithms and data structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #082241;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><a id="codereview"></a>Code Review</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The following video is a code review of my original artifacts from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization &amp; DAD 220: Intro to Structural Database Environments.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #082241;"><a id="softwaredesign"></a>Software Design and Engineering</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The original artifact I've included for this section comes from the course CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The main focus of the original assignment was collisions &amp; we made changes to collisions within the program. The ball could collide with other balls, squares, etc. Two types of collisions could happen with squares:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the squares disappear</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the ball bounces off the square</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When the balls collided with each other, the balls combined &amp; grew into one big ball. Lastly, the balls change colors whenever a collision happens &amp; if you press the space bar, you create new balls. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because although the initial assignment was simple, I wondered how easy it would be to make it into something more. There isn't a specific component of the artifact that highlights my skills. However, I did a complete overhaul of the program &amp; making those changes will display my expertise. The initial artifact didn't have an actual purpose, but converting it to a brick-breaker game gave it one &amp; that gave the program value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As I made changes to enhance this artifact, I didn't realize how much would be needed to transform it into something else. Initially, there were two types of squares &amp; I removed the functionality of the reflective squares. The main thing I learned while I improved this artifact is you have to plan for various scenarios. For example, I implemented a change (which I reverted) to the way the ball interacts with the side of the walls of the program window. I made the ball move in a straight line if it hit the side of the window. The problem with that approach is the ball will bounce in that straight line back &amp; forth continuously. Not initially understanding what would happen if I implemented these changes was a lesson learned. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The course outcome I planned to meet "demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practice for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals," &amp; I've met that goal. The original artifact didn't have a real purpose &amp; that means it had no real value. The program is now a game &amp; that gives it purpose, which gives it value. I have no plans to update my coverage plans &amp; I did what I needed to do to make this a functioning game. </span></p>

The initial artifact didn't have an actual purpose, but converting it to a brick-breaker game gave it one &amp; that gave the program value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The artifact I used for this section is the same artifact I used for the Software Engineering and Design section. Making the changes to the algorithms went very smoothly for the most part. The main challenge I faced was how collision detection worked &amp; clearing the bricks once the ball hit them. The problem I had with the bricks disappearing was that there were spots where the ball would hit the brick &amp; the brick wouldn't disappear. I also made other very complex changes to the collision detection system &amp; the lesson I learned is that simpler is sometimes better. Once I took the simple approach for the collision detection system, the bricks went away as intended &amp; the collisions were better overall. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The course outcome I planned to </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">fulfill,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> was to "design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices," &amp; I've met that objective. The problem I needed to solve was turning the original program into a brick-breaker game &amp; that required making enhancements to the collision detection system already in place. I created an algorithm for detecting the collision between the paddle &amp; the ball while also enhancing the algorithm for the collisions with the ball and the bricks. Implementing different game states was another enhancement I made. The game states detect when the game is over, the user has won, etc. I made a trade-off with the complexity of the algorithms in my program. I chose to go the simple route, and as a result, it made my code easy for me to read &amp; understand. But, that means I made a trade on performance.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #082241;" data-preserver-spaces="true"><a id="database"></a>Databases</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The original artifact I've included for this section comes from the course DAD 220: Intro to Structural Database Environments. The main focus of the original assignment was to teach us how to manage a MySQL database from the terminal. I didn't create the original artifact since our objective was to show we knew how to manage a MySQL database.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because although I found interacting with the database from the terminal simple, I felt it could be user-friendly. Creating a GUI made the most sense; it would allow users to point &amp; click without having to learn MySQL statements. Creating a GUI showcases my knowledge of C# &amp; my ability to design a usable application from scratch. Another skill I showcased is my ability to create complex queries for searching the tables, loading the customers, etc. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Research was the first step I took when planning to enhance this artifact. This project was my first time creating this type of application &amp; I wanted to make sure I was using the best approach while making changes that made sense. I created a local MySQL server &amp; created a Windows Forms app that served as my database application. The biggest lesson I learned is that having a local server might not be the best option, but it will depend on your use case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The course objective I planned on accomplishing is to "demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals," &amp; I've met that objective. The original artifact didn't have a real purpose or value because it focused on showing that we understood how to interact with a MySQL database, but that's as far as it went. Implementing these enhancements gives it value because now more users can interact with the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">database,</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> outside of users who know MySQL. </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #082241;" data-preserver-spaces="true">Course Outcomes</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overall, I met the following course outcomes by making changes to the two artifacts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><u><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">the field of</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> computer science.</span></u><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I took feedback from my professor on the changes I needed to make to my artifacts. We're collaborating on what approaches will &amp; won't work for my final changes.</span></li>
<li><u><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</span></u><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I've completed the code review </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that matches with this course outcome.</span></li>

I sacrificed the complexity of the algorithms in my program and went for a simple route, and as a result, it made my code easy for me to read &amp; understand. But, that means I made a trade on performance.</span></li>
<li><u><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</span></u><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Neither of my original artifacts had a real purpose &amp; I gave them both one.
