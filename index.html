    <section id="introduction">
        <p style="text-align: center;">My name is Ashley English &amp; this is my ePortfolio for CS-499.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="selfassessment">
        <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>Working towards my Computer Science degree, developing my ePortfolio & even thinking about my future career goals has been an empowering experience. Throughout this program, I've had the privilege of learning & refining my skills, tailoring my career path with the skills I've learned through coursework and real-world problems I could face throughout my career. </p>
        <h3>Collaborating in a team environment</h3>
        <p>Although collaboration isn't the first skill you think of when you think of Computer Science, it's vital in this field. I've completed a handful of team projects throughout this program; they emphasized the importance of communication. For example, a previous course required that I work with my classmates to add songs to a playlist project. This project was my first experience collaborating with others in GitHub. It required that I pull the latest version from GitHub (that included changes from my classmates) & merge my changes to the master project. This activity taught me the importance of effective communication, making sure any notes I add for the team are thorough and concise, & that not everyone has the same level of experience using this type of program, so communication is key.</p>
        <h3>Communicating with stakeholders</h3>
        <p>Communication is another skill you don't think of when you think of Computer Science, but my career plan is to become a developer. To ensure you're creating a product that meets the customer's needs, you must have the ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders. A previous course dealt with project management, sprint review meetings, etc. Sprint review meetings allow developers, stakeholders, and members of other teams to collaborate. Developers can show the work they've completed during the sprint & receive direct feedback from the stakeholders. These meetings are vital because they allow stakeholders to give feedback & the developer has the chance to communicate what is possible & what isn't. Learning about these processes has helped to drive home the point of how important it is to communicate with stakeholders. If you're creating a product that doesn't meet their requirements, you'll have completed all that work for nothing.</p>
        <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Having a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms is something I consider a necessity for Computer Science. Enhancing my artifact from CS 330 allowed me to practice the concepts I've learned throughout this program. I made enhancements to the collision detection algorithms to turn my artifact into a brick-breaker type of game. Completing these enhancements for the final project has shown me the importance of using the correct data structures and algorithms to improve the performance of your program. But it also helps to ensure you achieve the best balance of efficiency while maintaining complexity.</p>
        <h3>Software Engineering and Database</h3>
        <p>Database management & software engineering are two principles I applied when enhancing my artifact from DAD 220. The main focus of the DAD 220 course was managing MySQL databases with CRUD operations. Although I found interacting with the database from the terminal simple, I felt creating a GUI to manage those databases would be a good idea & that's where I was able to apply my software engineering know-how. Developing the database application required researching, planning, development, testing, etc. Overall, I was able to incorporate my software engineering & database management knowledge to create a working database application.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>Security is a vital skill in Computer Science, although it's not the first skill that comes to mind. Although I haven't had many experiences with security-specific projects, I have learned to integrate security best practices. I've also developed a security-minded foundation & that comes from a previous course where I learned about the software development life cycle (SDLC). Those lessons taught me to implement security in every aspect of the lifecycle, from the project planning to the deployment phase.</p>
        <h3>Artifact Summary</h3>
        <p>In my ePortfolio, I'll highlight the knowledge I've gained during my time in the Computer Science program with these artifacts. Each artifact acts as an example of my grasp on different key concepts & they showcase my ability to take the knowledge I've gained throughout my time at SNHU & apply it to real-world examples. These artifacts demonstrate my technical ability, but they also highlight my dedication to improvement & my ability to problem-solve complex issues that could arise while completing this type of work.</p>
        <p>I've included two artifacts in my ePortfolio. The first is a brick-breaker game I created from an artifact from a previous course, CS 330. The second artifact is a database application I created to manage a MySQL database & the original data comes from DAD 220. My brick breaker game & database application both showcase my software engineering & design capabilities. With the brick-breaker game, I transformed the program into a functioning game & I created the database application for managing a MySQL database. The database application also showcases my ability to manage a MySQL database, but it goes further because now users can point & click instead of using the terminal. The brick-breaker game displays my ability to create/enhance algorithms to implement game-like mechanics into my program. Overall, the brick-breaker game & database application come together as a complete portfolio because it shows my abilities from software engineering to database management & algorithms and data structures.</p>

    <section id="softwaredesign">
        <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The artifact I selected for Software Design and Engineering is the brick breaker game I enhanced from my previous course, CS 330. The original artifact was a project that allowed you to interact with objects in a scene. The original artifact had a paddle-like object that allowed the user to move left and right across the scene. I've transformed the artifact into a fully functioning brick-breaker game by incorporating a ball and bricks & implemented collision detection so the ball bounces off the walls, paddle, and bricks.</p>
        <h3>Enhancements</h3>
        <p>I've transformed this artifact by adding a ball, bricks, collision detection & functionality to the ball & paddle, which allows them to interact with each other. This artifact demonstrates my software design & engineering skills because I could practice concepts like implementing libraries to handle the game's mechanics. Adding those enhancements was possible because I applied the software engineering concepts I've learned during my time at SNHU. The final result is a game that functions & allows the user to interact with objects within the scene. My brick-breaker game also highlights my ability to problem-solve complex issues within a program. It also shows my ability to take a problem, break it down, and develop a solution.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this artifact was correctly implementing collision detection to ensure the ball could bounce off the paddle, bricks & walls. I also faced another challenge while implementing my brick-breaker game with the class framework.</p>
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Although I had challenges, the end product of my brick-breaker game highlights my skills in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzing complex computing problems & applying principles of computing & other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.</li>
            <li>Designing, implementing, and evaluating a computing-based solution to meet computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="algorithm">
        <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The artifact I selected for Algorithms and Data Structures is the same brick breaker game I enhanced from CS 330. This artifact was chosen because it incorporates different data structures and algorithms to allow the user to interact with objects in the scene. The enhancements I've made to this artifact demonstrate my ability to use data structures and algorithms in a program. My brick-breaker game shows how different data structures can be implemented and used to ensure the program runs smoothly and efficiently.</p>
        <h3>Enhancements</h3>
        <p>I've transformed this artifact by adding a ball, bricks, collision detection & functionality to the ball & paddle, which allows them to interact with each other. This artifact demonstrates my ability to use data structures and algorithms because I've implemented different data structures to ensure the program runs smoothly. For example, I've used arrays to store the bricks' positions and states. This allows the program to iterate through the array to determine which bricks have been hit & which ones are still active.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this artifact was correctly implementing the data structures to ensure the program could efficiently manage the bricks' positions and states. I also faced another challenge while implementing collision detection to ensure the ball could bounce off the paddle, bricks & walls.</p>
        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Although I had challenges, the end product of my brick-breaker game highlights my skills in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzing complex computing problems & applying principles of computing & other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.</li>
            <li>Designing, implementing, and evaluating a computing-based solution to meet computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
  <section id="database">
    <h2 style="color: #082241;">Databases</h2>
    <p>
        The original artifact I've included for this section comes from the course DAD 220: Intro to Structural Database Environments. The main focus of the original assignment was to teach us how to manage a MySQL database from the terminal. I didn't create the original artifact since our objective was to show we knew how to manage a MySQL database.
    </p>
    <p>
        I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because although I found interacting with the database from the terminal simple, I felt it could be user-friendly. Creating a GUI made the most sense; it would allow users to point & click without having to learn MySQL statements. Creating a GUI showcases my knowledge of C# & my ability to design a usable application from scratch. Another skill I showcased is my ability to create complex queries for searching the tables, loading the customers, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Research was the first step I took when planning to enhance this artifact. This project was my first time creating this type of application & I wanted to make sure I was using the best approach while making changes that made sense. I created a local MySQL server & created a Windows Forms app that served as my database application. The biggest lesson I learned is that having a local server might not be the best option, but it will depend on your use case.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course objective I planned on accomplishing is to "demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals," & I've met that objective. The original artifact didn't have a real purpose or value because it focused on showing that we understood how to interact with a MySQL database, but that's as far as it went. Implementing these enhancements gives it value because now more users can interact with the database, outside of users who know MySQL.
    </p>

<section id="course-outcomes">
    <h2 style="color: #082241;">Course Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, I met the following course outcomes by making changes to the two artifacts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <u>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.</u> I took feedback from my professor on the changes I needed to make to my artifacts. We're collaborating on what approaches will & won't work for my final changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</u> I've completed the code review and that matches with this course outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</u> The brick-breaker artifact includes algorithms for calculating the collisions in my program. I sacrificed the complexity of the algorithms in my program and went for a simple route, and as a result, it made my code easy for me to read & understand. But, that means I made a trade on performance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</u> Neither of my original artifacts had a real purpose & I gave them both one. For example, I transformed my program into a brick-breaker game & I created a GUI for managing the MySQL database.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The course outcome I didn't meet:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
        </li>
    </ul>
